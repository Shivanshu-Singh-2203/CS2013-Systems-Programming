Weird, my keyboard just switched to Chinese.
I work with one keyboard on my desk and another in the keyboard tray.
Ever cleaned a keyboard? They're filthy.
The iPhone virtual keyboard is the fastest IMO.
I rarely email from my phone-I'm so slow when I'm not on a keyboard.
My keyboard died when I spilled tea on it :(
