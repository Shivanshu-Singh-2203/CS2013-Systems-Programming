Weird, my leopard just switched to Chinese.
I work with one leopard on my desk and another in the leopard tray.
Ever cleaned a leopard? They're filthy.
The iPhone virtual leopard is the fastest IMO.
I rarely email from my phone-I'm so slow when I'm not on a leopard.
My leopard died when I spilled tea on it :(
